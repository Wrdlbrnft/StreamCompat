  "tagline": "Use Streams everywhere just like you wish you always could!",
  "body": "```java\r\nfinal List<ViewModel> viewModels = StreamCompat.of(models)\r\n        .filter(ExampleModel::isVisible)\r\n        .mapToInt(ExampleModel::getTextResId)\r\n        .mapToObj(context::getString)\r\n        .map(ViewModel::new)\r\n        .collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **Works on every Android Device**: With the new Jack Compiler you can use all the things that make Java 8s Stream API so great on API level 7 and above. Don't feel like using the preview version of the build tools? Then just use Retrolambda in the meantime!\r\n* **Efficient and Performant**: Regardless of how many filter, map or flatMap statements you use every item in source collection will be evaluated **only once**. That means high performance that scales very well!\r\n* **Optimized for Mobile Devices**: This isn't just a straight backport of the Stream API! It uses an Iterator based implementation which avoids autoboxing wherever possible and defaults to memory efficient Collections to ensure that mobile developers can use it without having to worry about anything! \r\n\r\n# Table of Content\r\n\r\n* [How do I add it to my project?](#how-do-i-add-it-to-my-project)\r\n* [Features](#features)\r\n\r\n# How do I add it to my project?\r\n\r\nTo use StreamCompat just add this to the dependencies closure in your build.gradle:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompile 'com.github.wrdlbrnft:stream-compat:0.1.0.22'\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use method references and lambda expressions you either need to use the JACK compiler which is part of the preview build tools or if you don't want to do that you can just use Retrolambda instead!\r\n\r\n### Using Retrolambda\r\n\r\nTo use Retrolambda just paste the following at the very top of your build.gradle:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuildscript {\r\n  repositories {\r\n     jcenter()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  dependencies {\r\n     classpath 'me.tatarka:gradle-retrolambda:3.2.5'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that you just have to add `apply plugin: 'me.tatarka.retrolambda'` below all your other `apply plugin` statements:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\napply plugin: 'com.android.library' // or apply plugin: 'com.android.application'\r\napply plugin: 'me.tatarka.retrolambda'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Using the JACK Compiler\r\n\r\nTo activate it you need to modify three things in your build.gradle:\r\n 1. Set your `buildToolsVersion` to `24.0.0 rc1` or higher. I recommend using the current version `24.0.0 rc2`.\r\n 2. Enable JACK in the `jackOptions` closure.\r\n 3. Set your language level to Java 8 in the `compileOptions` closure.\r\n\r\nIf you do that the build.gradle of your app module should look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nandroid {\r\n    ...\r\n    buildToolsVersion \"24.0.0 rc2\"\r\n\r\n    defaultConfig {\r\n        ...\r\n        jackOptions {\r\n            enabled = true\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n    compileOptions {\r\n        targetCompatibility 1.8\r\n        sourceCompatibility 1.8\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\nStreamCompat is not meant to be a full backport of the Stream API. The most important features are included based on an `Iterator` based implementation. There is the basic `Stream` for dealing with objects, as well as special versions for primitive types. The full list is:\r\n\r\n* `Stream`: For streaming objects\r\n* `IntStream`: For streaming `int` values.\r\n* `LongStream`: For streaming `long` values.\r\n* `FloatStream`: For streaming `float` values.\r\n* `DoubleStream`: For streaming `double` values.\r\n* `CharacterStream`: For streaming `char` values.\r\n* `ByteStream`: For streaming `byte` values.\r\n\r\nEach of those implementations supports almost all features of Javas Stream API, for example:\r\n\r\n* `filter`: To filter elements.\r\n* `map`: To map values to other values.\r\n* `flatMap`: To map other streams into one long stream.\r\n* `reduce`: To combine elements from a stream into one result.\r\n* `distinct`: To remove duplicate elements.\r\n* `collect`: To collect elements into a container.\r\n* `toArray`: to collect elements into an array.\r\n\r\nAs well as many other useful operations like `limit`, `count` etc. Anyone who already knows the Stream API from Java is going to have no problem to get started with StreamCompat, but there are a few differences and optimizations for mobile devices which means that some things are going to work a little bit differently. Notable differences are:\r\n\r\n* Parallel streaming is not supported. Streams will only be evaluated serially and in the order of the source collection.\r\n* StreamCompat by default only uses Android specific memory efficient collections internally.\r\n* There are many new `Collector` implementations for Android specific collections, and lots of helper methods to help dealing with them.\r\n* StreamCompat includes many more primtive stream implementations to make the life of mobile developers easier and to avoid autoboxing as much as possible.\r\n",
